            Adding the stylesheet is the minimum required to get up and 
            running. This will add the published version of your stylesheet to 
            your page but provides no ability to preview your styles as you 
            make changes.
        javascript:
          header: "Include the Javascript Utility"
          instructions: >
            Add the ability to preview your stylesheets with the javascript 
            utility. Place this at the end of your document. We keep it very 
            small so it has no impact on your sites performance.
        example:
          full:
            header: "Full Example"
            head_content: "Your current head content"
            body_content: "Your current body content"
        go_back: "Back to Stylesheets"
