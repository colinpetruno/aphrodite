            Aphrodite Stylesheets can be embedded just like any other 
            stylesheet. We make it easy by adding the code in the embed 
            section. Just copy it into the head of your document and you are 
            all set. Aphrodite takes care of minifying and serves your 
            stylesheets over CDN for the fastest loading times.

            What sets Aphrodite apart is its very tiny Javascript utility. This 
            utility adds the ability to preview your stylesheet live on your 
            site in a way that only you can see! No more editing styles on a 
            live site and hoping nothing breaks. Make your changes in 
            confidence and then simply publish the stylesheet when you are 
            happy with the changes.

            Aphrodite is built on the official Sass port of Bootstrap 3 
            maintained by Twitter. For Bootstrap 4 we use the native Sass 
            files. <br><br>

            As you update your stylesheet we recompile the stylesheet and 
            reload the preview with the actual outputted stylesheet. This is 
            not an approximation or 'preview' of the stylesheet. It is the real 
            thing so there are no surprises when you publish it to your site.
            <br><br>

            In order to keep things as fast as possible, Aphrodite uses the C 
            port of the Sass compiler.<br><br>

            Aphrodite manages your stylesheet on Cloudflare CDN after it's 
            published. This ensures the fastest loading stylesheet while 
            reducing the load on your server. If our site has issues for any 
            reason, your stylesheets will continue to be served through 
            Cloudflare with no interruption.<br><br>
